# RussianOCR
This bash script will prompt user to submit an image of Russian text in terminal window. Then the script will convert the image into a workable text document. This will run on both Mac and Linux. This is version 2. Notes: accuracy of conversion depends on quality of the image, as well as the limitations of the tesseract OCR engine.
